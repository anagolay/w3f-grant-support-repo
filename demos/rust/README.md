# Hi and welcome to rust demo

This code is made to demonstrate execution of the created workflow. 

Follow these steps to get the demo running.

## Step 1

Find your workflow name in the CLI output. It looks like this `> Workflow name:  workflow_compute_cidv1`.

Find the `git` artifact CID, that is your executable code with WASM. You sould look for it in the table in the console output under the `{ Git: Null }` row.
## Step 2

Open the [./Cargo.toml](./Cargo.toml) and replace the `WORKFLOW_NAME` and `WORKFLOW_GIT_CID` with the values from above.

## Step 3

```sh
cargo run
```

You should see something like this ( with your git artifact cid ):

```
gitpod /workspace/w3f-grant-support-repo/demos/rust (project-idiyanale-phase1_milestone-2) $ cargo run
    Updating git repository `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/bafybeidmwf3v7hyyvi5jszj47etsoo6bxdrfuc3cdhyovkdjjqzh7rjhdm`

```

You can also specify an URL:

```sh
cargo run -- <your_url>

# or you can try this 
cargo run -- https://ipfs.anagolay.network/ipfs/bafybeidiqckvpknwussyli5r5vt65np7jiblh6m72xrwvgzy4usyrj6eva
```

> This will work for ANY publicly availale data.

## Step 4

There is no step 4. Congrats you have executed the Anagolay workflow. ðŸŽ‰

We encourage you to check the code and experiment
